Simple 360 Video player for iOS using SceneKit. VR ready

We generate a simple scene in which we add a sphere centered on the user point of view (i.e. the cameras in (0,0,0)).
Then we project a texture displaying a SpriteKit scene showing the video on the sphere material.

We added the ability to pan through the scene with swipes.

Just remove the rightScene to have a non-VR video 360 Video player.

Hope this will be useful.
